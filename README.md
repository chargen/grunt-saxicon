# ðŸŽ· grunt-saxicon

[![npm version][npm-img]](https://badge.fury.io/js/grunt-saxicon)
![Build status][build-img]

> grunt-saxicon takes a folder of SVGs and produces a SASS snippet that allows you to generate colorized SVGs (with both single or multi-colored shapes) within SASS, embedded as a data-URI.

ðŸŒ± **This is a beta release**. For the last stable version, see [v0.2.5](https://github.com/lachlanmcdonald/grunt-saxicon/tree/v0.2.5).

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-saxicon@0.3.0-beta.2 --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-saxicon');
```

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

Add the following to your `Gruntfile.js`:

```js
require('load-grunt-tasks')(grunt);
grunt.initConfig({
    saxicon: {
        taskName: {
            source: "path/to/svgs/",
            scss: "path/to/saxicon.scss"
        }   
    }
});
```

Then in your SCSS files, import the SCSS output:

```scss
@include "path/to/saxicon";
```

### Single color SVGs

To output a SVG in a single color, you can call the `sax` function with a single color as shown below:

```scss
.red-arrow {
    background-image: sax(arrow, #F00);
}
```

Which will compile to:

```css
.red-arrow {
    background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,...");
}
```

### Multi-color SVGs

To output a SVG in multiple colors, first you must replace the `stroke` and `fill` attributes in your SVG with a [color keyword][colors] â€”Â i.e. `red`, `magenta`, etc. The keyword you choose are used as a reference for when you want to replace that color in your SASS.

For example, with the following SVG:

```xml
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20">
    <rect fill="red" x="0" y="0" width="10" height="10"/>
    <rect fill="blue" x="10" y="10" width="10" height="10"/>
</svg>
```

You can replace these colors in your SASS with:

```scss
.arrow {
    background-image: sax(arrow, $red: #d700ee, $blue: #9600bb);
}
```

By default, if you do not include a replacement color, the original color (as defined in the SVG) will be used instead. Whilst this is useful for debugging, you can also set a default color as the second argument for when a keyword is omitted:

```scss
.arrow {
    background-image: sax(arrow, #000, $red: #d700ee);
}
```

Additionally, you can use a [variable arguments][sass-var-args] for consistent theming:

```scss
$theme: ("red": #d700ee, "blue": #9600bb);

.arrow {
    background-image: sax(arrow, $theme...);
}
```

<h2 id="options">Options</h2>

**source**  
Type: `String`

Path to the directory which contains the SVG files.

- This path is not searched recursively.
- It is highly recommended that you minify these filesÂ first using [svgo] or [grunt-svgmin].

**scss**  
Type: `String`  

Destination for SCSS output.

**iconName**  
Type: `Function`

Optional callback function used to generate icon names for your SCSS and SVG files. By default, each SVG will be named after the original filename without its extension. i.e. `arrow-left.svg` becomes `arrow-left`.

Function receives the filename and should return the icon's name as a string.

```js
{
    iconName: function(fileName) {
        return fileName.replace(/^(.*)\.svg$/, '$1');
    }
}
```

**defaultColor**  
Type: `String`

Certain SVG shapes are presumed to have a fill, even if a `fill` attribute it not provided. By default, these shapes are given a fill of `black`. If provided, this option overrides the default value for the `fill` attribute.

(If no fill is desired, you should add `fill="none"` to the shape in your SVG.)

**autoColorNaming**  
Type: `Boolean`

By default, hex colors are replaced with their [SVG color keyword][colors] (i.e. `red` instead of `#F00`). If `false`, automatic replacements are not performed.

**preferGray**  
Type: `Boolean`

Optional. If `true`, automatic conversion of SVG color names will prefer "gr<u>a</u>y" over "gr<u>e</u>y." This option will not change colors that were already defined with a [SVG color keyword][colors].

<h2 id="sass">SASS</h2>

__sax__($icon, $keywords...)

- **$icon** ([String][sass-string]): Icon name
- **$keywords...** Color replacements, see below

Returns the specified icon, either in a single color or in multiple colors, as a data-URI. Colors are converted to a six-digit hex string (alpha is not included). Raises an error if the icon does not exist.

To replace a single color:

```scss
.arrow {
    background-image: sax(arrow, #000);
}
```

To replace with multiple-colors:

```scss
.arrow {
    background-image: sax(arrow, $red: #d700ee, $blue: #9600bb);
}
```

To replace with some colors and an optional default:

```scss
.arrow {
    background-image: sax(arrow, #000, $red: #d700ee);
}
```

__sax-width__ ($icon)  
__sax-height__ ($icon)

- **$icon** ([String][sass-string]): Icon name

Returns the icon's width or height in pixels, as defined by the SVG's `width` and `height` attributes (or the `viewBox` attribute). This isn't guaranteed to be a whole-number if the SVG uses fractional dimensions. Raises an error if the icon does not exist.

```scss
.arrow {
    background-size: sax-width(arrow) sax-height(arrow);
    width: sax-width(arrow);
    height: sax-height(arrow);
}
```

```css
.arrow {
    background-size: 9px 12px;
    width: 9px;
    height: 12px;
}
```

__sax-classes__($color, $prefix)

- **$color** ([Color]([sass-color]))
- **$prefix** ([String][sass-string]): Prepended to every rule. Defaults to `.icon-`.

Outputs a class for every icon in the specified color. This mixin also outputs a `width`, `height` and `background-size` based on the SVG's original dimensions.

```scss
@include sax-classes(red, ".icon-red-");
```

```css
.icon-red-up-arrow {...}
.icon-red-left-arrow {...}
.icon-red-down-arrow {...}
.icon-red-right-arrow {...}
```

<h2 id="advanced-options">Advanced options</h2>

> These options are secondary to colorizing and embedded SVGs in your CSS, but are included as they might come in handy.

**svgs.target**  
Type: `String`

If provided, colorizes and exports the SVGs in a single color into the directory provided. If provided, you must also specify the `svgs.colors`. See also: `outputPath`.

```js
{
    svgs: {
        target: "path/to/output",
        colors: {
            red: "#F00",
            green: "#0F0"
        }
    }
}
```

**svgs.colors**  
Type: `String`

An object of color-name pairs. Each key is the color's name, and its value the color that will be injected into the SVG files. See example above.

**outputPath**  
Type: `Function`

Optional callback function used to generate the output path for exported SVGs. Paths are relative to the `svgs.target` property. See below for more information.

**json**  
Type: `String`

If provided, exports the intermediate SVG data in a single JSON file. Useful for testing, or as input for use with other tasks, etc.

### Outputting individual SVG files

Along with SASS, grunt-saxicon can also be used to colorize SVGs and output into a directory of your choosing. Suitable for embedding on a page or use with a CMS.

By default, SVG output will be named after the original file and the color name. For example, if you have `arrow-left.svg` and `arrow-right.svg` with the following properties:

```js
svgs: {
    colors: {
        red: "#F00",
        green: "#0F0"
    }
}
```

Will generate:

- `arrow-left.green.svg`
- `arrow-left.red.svg`
- `arrow-right.green.svg`
- `arrow-right.red.svg`

You can override the path and filenames with the `outputPath` option:

```js
svgs: {
    outputPath: function(filePath, iconName, colorName, color) {
        return iconName + '.' + colorName + '.svg';
    }
}
```

The function will receive these arguments for every icon-color combination:

- **filePath** (String): Path to the SVG, relative Grunt's current working directory (CWD). You can use npm's `path.basename()` if you want just the file-name.
- **iconName** (String): Icon name. Can be changed with the `iconName` option.
- **colorName** (String): Color's name. This is each key in the `colors` object.
- **color** (String): Color. The is each value in the `colors` object.

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<h3 id="colors-in-svgs">Colors in SVGs</h3>

grunt-saxicon only works with the `fill` and `stroke` attributes. If you use `style` attributes, you should first convert these to attributes using [svgo] or [grunt-svgmin].

Styles applied via the `<style>` tag are ignored.

By default, colors are converted to their [SVG color keyword][colors] (configurable with the `autoColorNaming` option). Some colors share the same keyword, as noted below:

- `cyan` is used instead of `aqua`
- `magenta` is used instead of `fushsia`
- Gr<u>e</u>y not gr<u>a</u>y. If you are feeling especially pedantic, you may use the `preferGray` option.

<h3 id="tests">Tests</h3>

To run the tests, you will need both:

1. [Ruby SASS](http://sass-lang.com/unstall) â€” available in your test environment as `sass`
2. A wrapper around [libsass](http://github.com/sass/libsass) (like [SassC](https://github.com/sass/sassc), which can be installed on macOS with [Homebrew](http://brewformulas.org/Sassc)) â€”Â available in your test environment as `sassc`

To run the tests:

```sh
grunt test
```

<h3 id="browser-support">Browser Support</h3>

Data URI-encoded SVG files are supported in all ever-green browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge) and Internet Explorer 9+.

<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>

#### SVG display issues in IE

SVGs, when resized using `background-size` sometimes clip beyond the element's boundaries or appear mis-aligned. This especially occurs when using a value of `cover` or `contain`.

Whilst not identical, values of `100% auto` or `auto 100%` (or absolute values in pixels) should to fix these display issues.

#### "Variable keyword argument map must have string keys"

When using [variable arguments][sass-var-args], keys must be strings, as shown below:

```scss
$theme: ("red": #d700ee, "blue": #9600bb);
```

With [certain versions of libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues/2352), you may recieve a `Segmentation fault: 11` error instead of the above error message.

#### Reducing redundancy in generated CSS

You may find your generated CSS can become large if you reuse the same icon and color combination across a number of selectors.

One solution is to extend a [placeholder selector](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#placeholder_selectors_):

```scss
%icon-arrow-red {
    background-image: sax(arrow, red);
    background-size: sax-width(arrow) sax-height(arrow);
    width: sax-width(arrow);
    height: sax-height(arrow);
}

.a {@extend %icon-arrow-red;}
.b {@extend %icon-arrow-red;}
.c {@extend %icon-arrow-red;}
```

```css
.a, .b, .c {
    background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml, ... ");
    background-size: 9px 12px;
    width: 9px;
    height: 12px;
}
```

You can also create placeholder selectors for every icon at once with the `sax-classes()` mixin:

```scss
@include sax-classes(red, '%icon-');

.a {@extend %icon-arrow;}
.b {@extend %icon-arrow;}
.c {@extend %icon-arrow;}
```

Keep in that mind that selectors which `@extend` placeholder selectors are included in your CSS output at the location where the placeholder selector was defined. Be mindful of specificity, if you wish to change these classes later.
