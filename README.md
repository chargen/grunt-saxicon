![Build status][build-img]

> grunt-saxicon takes a folder of SVGs and produces a SASS snippet that allows you to generate colorized SVGs (with multi-color support) within SASS embedded as a data-URI.

## Getting started

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-saxicon --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-saxicon');
```

## Task

Add the following to your `Gruntfile.js`:

```js
require('load-grunt-tasks')(grunt);
grunt.initConfig({
	saxicon: {
		taskName: {
			source: "path/to/svgs/",
			scss: "path/to/saxicon.scss"
		}	
	}
});
```

Then in your SCSS files, import the SCSS output:

```scss
@include "path/to/saxicon";
```

### Single color SVGs

To output a SVG in a single color, you can call the `sax` function with a single color (and no keyword arguments) as shown below:

```scss
.red-arrow {
    background-image: sax(arrow, #F00);
}
```
```css
.red-arrow {
	background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,...");
}
```

### Multi-color SVGs

To output a SVG in a single color, first you must replace the `stroke` and `fill` attributes in your SVG with a [SVG color keyword][colors] â€”Â i.e. `red`, `magenta`, or `lightcoral`. The keyword you choose is used as a reference to replace that color in your SASS.

For example, if your SVG were to contain:

```xml
    <rect fill="red" x="10" y="10" width="10" height="10"/>
	<rect fill="blue" x="20" y="20" width="10" height="10"/>
```

You can replace these colors in your SASS with:

```scss
.arrow {
    background-image: sax(arrow, $red: #d700ee, $blue: #9600bb);
}
```

By default, if you do not include a color keyword, the original color (as defined in the SVG) will be used instead. Whilst this is useful for debugging, you can also set a default color for when a keyword is omitted:

```scss
.arrow {
    background-image: sax(arrow, #000, $red: #d700ee);
}
```

## Options

**source**  
Type: `String`

Path to the directory which contains the SVG files.

- This path is not searched recursively
- It is highly recommended that you minify these filesÂ first using [grunt-svgmin]

**scss**  
Type: `String`  

Destination file for SCSS output.

**iconName**  
Type: `Function`

Optional callback function used to generate icon names for your SCSS and SVG files.

**defaultColor**  
Type: `String`

Certain SVG shapes are presumed to have a fill, even if a `fill` attribute it not provided. By default, these shapes are given a fill of `black`. If provided, this option overrides the default value for the `fill` attribute.

(If no fill is desired, you should add `fill="none"` to the shape in your SVG.)

**autoColorNaming**  
Type: `Boolean`

By default, hex colors are replaced with their [SVG color keyword][colors] (i.e. `red` instead of `#F00`). If `false`, no replacement is performed.

**preferGray**  
Type: `Boolean`

Optional. If `true`, automatic conversion of SVG color names will prefer "gray" over "grey." 

## Icon names

Each SVG will be named after the original  filename (without its extension).  
i.e. `arrow-left.svg` becomes `arrow-left`.

You can override how the names are produced by providing your own function to `iconName`:

```js
{
	iconName: function(fileName) {
		return fileName.replace(/^.*_(.*)\.svg$/, '$1');
	}
}
```

The function must return a valid [SASS map key](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#maps). (Will work when passed to [`map-get()`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#map_get-instance_method))

## SASS

__sax__($icon, $args...)

- **$icon** ([String][sass-string]): Icon name
- **$args...** Color replacements, see below

Returns the specified icon, either in a single color or in multiple colors, as a data-URI. Colors are converted to a six-digit hex string (alpha is not included). Raises an error if the icon does not exist.

To replace a single color:

```scss
.arrow {
    background-image: sax(arrow, #000);
}
```

To replace with multiple-colors:

```scss
.arrow {
    background-image: sax(arrow, $red: #d700ee, $blue: #9600bb);
}
```

To replace with some colors and an optional default:

```scss
.arrow {
    background-image: sax(arrow, #000, $red: #d700ee);
}
```

__sax-width__ ($icon)  
__sax-height__ ($icon)

- **$icon** ([String][sass-string]): Icon name

Returns the icon's width or height in pixels, as defined by the SVG's `width` and `height` attributes (or the `viewBox` attribute). This isn't guaranteed to be a whole-number if the SVG uses fractional dimensions. Raises an error if the icon does not exist.

```scss
.arrow {
	background-size: sax-width(arrow) sax-height(arrow);
	width: sax-width(arrow);
	height: sax-height(arrow);
}
```

```css
.arrow {
	background-size: 9px 12px;
	width: 9px;
	height: 12px;
}
```

__sax-classes__($color, $prefix)

- **$color** ([Color]([sass-color]))
- **$prefix** ([String][sass-string]): Prepended to every rule. Defaults to `.icon-`.

Outputs a class for every icon in the specified color. This mixin also outputs a `width`, `height` and `background-size` based on the SVG's original dimensions.

```scss
@include sax-classes(red, ".icon-red-");
```

```css
.icon-red-up-arrow {...}
.icon-red-left-arrow {...}
.icon-red-down-arrow {...}
.icon-red-right-arrow {...}
```

## Advanced options

> These options are secondary to colorizing and embedded SVGs in your CSS, but are included as they might come in handy for some projects.

**svgs.target**  
Type: `String`

If provided, colorizes and exports the SVGs in a single color into the directory provided. If provided, you must also specify the `svgs.colors`. See also: `outputPath`.

```js
{
	svgs: {
		target: "path/to/output",
		colors: {
			red: "#F00",
			green: "#0F0"
		}
	}
}
```

**svgs.colors**  
Type: `String`

An object of color-name pairs. Each key is the color's name, and its value the color that will be injected into the SVG files. See example above.

**outputPath**  
Type: `Function`

Optional callback function used to generate the output path for exported SVGs. Paths are relative to the `svgs.target` property.

```js
{
	outputPath: function(filePath, iconName, colorName, color) {
		return iconName + '__' + colorName.toUpperCase() + '.svg';
	}
}
```

**json**  
Type: `String`

If provided, exports the intermediate SVG data in a single JSON file. Useful for testing, or as input for use with other tasks, etc.

### Outputting individual SVG files

Along with SASS, grunt-saxicon can also be used to colorize SVGs and output into a directory of your choosing. Suitable for embedding on a page or use with a CMS.

By default, SVG output will be named after the original file and the color name. For example, if you have `arrow-left.svg` and `arrow-right.svg` with the following properties:

```js
svgs: {
	colors: {
		red: "#F00",
		green: "#0F0"
	}
}
```

Will generate:

- `arrow-left.green.svg`
- `arrow-left.red.svg`
- `arrow-right.green.svg`
- `arrow-right.red.svg`

You can override the path and filenames with the `outputPath` option:

```js
svgs: {
	outputPath: function(filePath, iconName, colorName, color) {
		return iconName + '.' + colorName + '.svg';
	}
}
```

The function will receive these arguments for every icon-color combination:

- **filePath** (String): Path to the SVG, relative Grunt's current working directory (CWD). You can use npm's `path.basename()` if you want just the file-name.
- **iconName** (String): Icon name. Can be changed with the `iconName` option.
- **colorName** (String): Color's name. This is each key in the `colors` object.
- **color** (String): Color. The is each value in the `colors` object.

## Housekeeping & Notes

### Colors in SVGs

grunt-saxicon only works with the `fill` and `stroke` attributes. If you use `style` attributes, you should first convert these to attributes using [svgo] or [grunt-svgmin].

Styles applied via the `<style>` tag are ignored.

By default, colors are converted to their [SVG color keyword][colors] (configurable with the `autoColorNaming` option). Some colors share the same keyword, as noted below:

- `cyan` is used instead of `aqua`
- `magenta` is used instead of `fushsia`
- Gr_e_y not gr_a_y. If you are feeling especially pedantic, you may use the `preferGray` option.

### Running tests

To run the tests, you will need both:

1. [Ruby SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install) â€” available in your test environment as `sass`
2. A wrapper around [libsass](http://github.com/sass/libsass) (like [SassC](https://github.com/sass/sassc), which can be installed on macOS with [Homebrew](http://brewformulas.org/Sassc)) â€”Â available in your test environment as `sassc`

To run the tests, use:

```sh
grunt test
```

### Support

Data URI-encoded SVG files using the above method is supported in all ever-green browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge) and Internet Explorer 9+.

### Best practices

You may find your generated CSS gets large if you reuse the same icon and color combination across a number of selectors.

Instead, extend a [placeholder selector](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#placeholder_selectors_):

```scss
%icon-arrow-red {
	background-image: sax(arrow, red);
	background-size: sax-width(arrow) sax-height(arrow);
	width: sax-width(arrow);
	height: sax-height(arrow);
}

.a {@extend %icon-arrow-red;}
.b {@extend %icon-arrow-red;}
.c {@extend %icon-arrow-red;}
```

```css
.a, .b, .c {
	background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml, ... ");
	background-size: 9px 12px;
	width: 9px;
	height: 12px;
}
```

You can also create placeholder selectors for every icon at once with the `sax-classes()` mixin:

```scss
@include sax-classes(red, '%icon-');

.a {@extend %icon-arrow;}
.b {@extend %icon-arrow;}
.c {@extend %icon-arrow;}
```

Keep in that mind that selectors which `@extend` placeholder selectors are included in your CSS output at the location where the placeholder selector was defined. Be mindful of specificity, if you wish to change these classes later.
